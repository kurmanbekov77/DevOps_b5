A vaariable in programming is like a container where we can store the data 

Why do we use variables?

1. Storage-->
    Variables allow us to store data that we can use and modify later

2. Readability-->
    Makes our code easier to understand and debug and find what the 
    data represents.
    ** Debug mostly means going over the code again for the purpose os 
    understanding or finding the mistake
3. Reusability-->
    Once a value is sorted in a variable, you can use that variable 
    multiple times in different parts of your code.

   Formula of The Variable Creation
    variablename = value

    Naming a variable 
      Rules: 
             Vriable cannot start with a number.
             It cannot have spaces 
             It only contain alphanumeric characters and underscore(_).
                * alphanumeric: numbers AND letters 
            Variable names are case sensitive which means
            "age" is not same as "Age".
    Naming a Conventions
      *Convention--> how do you name the variable 


    There are 4 diffirent types of naming conventions:
        1.Camel case
          Naming starts with a lower case and capatalizes each word after that.
          Ex: firstName, lastName, areaCode etc.
          Note: Most java, javascript users


        2.Pascal case
          Naming starts with a upper case and capatilizes each word after that.
          Ex: FirstName, LastName, AreaCode etc.


        3. Snake case
          Each word in a variable name is separated by underscore(_).
          Ex: first_name, last_name, area_code etc
          Note: Most of Python users.


        4.Kebab case
        Each word in a variable name is separated by hyphen(-)
        Ex: first-name, last-name, area-code etc.


Note: When creating a variable type of variable is auto understood by Python.

Type of Numerical variables
  1.Integer: Represents whole numbers.
   Ex: age = 25
  2. Float: Pepresents real numbers.(Numbers with decimal points.) 
   Ex: weight: 190.4, avg 8.0
  3. Complex: Represents complex nu,bers that has both imiganary and real parts.
   Ex: 5+ 4j --> 5 is the real part, 4j is the imijanary part



Type Function
   The type( ) function is a built-in Python function
   used to determine the data type of a variable 
     Ex: a=10
         print(type(a)) #Output <class 'int'>
         b = 10.1
         print(type(b)) #Output <class ; float'>
    Importance:
    Helps debugging
    Useful when learning because it helps you to 
    understand how python works with data types.
 Creating Multiple Variables In Single Line
    We can define multiple variable on a single line,
    by separating them with commas(,)
        Syntax: a,b,c = 1.1, 1, "h"
    Advantage:
        Reduce the line of youur code.
        More readible
        Compact code

Assingning Multiple Variables with a Same Value
    Ex: a = b = c = d = 5
        #in the line above variable a, b, c and d will
        #be assigned with a value 5 and type of all Variables
        #will be integer.
ReAssigment in Python
    After variables assigned with a value we can also 
    assign a new value to them 
    Ex: var1 = 6
        var1 = "d"
        var1 = 1.0
