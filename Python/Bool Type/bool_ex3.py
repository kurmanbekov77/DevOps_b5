# We are given 3 sides of a triangle.
#Triangle is equilataral when all sides are the same.
#So in this code we have to display True when triangle is equilataral,
#False otherwise.

a = 9
b = 9
c = 10



is_equilataral = a==b == c
#The calculation above is possible 
#baecause python supports
#chained comparison operator

print(is_equilataral)
